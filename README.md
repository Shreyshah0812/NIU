Project proposal
•	Synopsis This project aims to enhance the BrainGlobe Cellfinder tool by replacing the existing ResNet-based classifier with a more efficient deep-learning architecture. Potential alternatives include Vision Transformers, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. The goal is to improve classification accuracy, reduce computation time, and enhance memory efficiency while ensuring compatibility with large whole-brain images.
Why cellfinder? Accurate cell classification in large-scale mammalian brain images is crucial for neuroscience research. Current manual segmentation techniques are time-consuming and prone to human error. A more advanced deep-learning model can provide faster, more reliable results, aiding researchers worldwide.
Why this project? The project will explore alternative architectures that leverage modern deep learning advancements to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. By integrating these models into cellfinder, we aim to enhance its usability for researchers working with whole-brain imaging data.

•	The Open-Source Community Benefits:
1.	Improved classification accuracy and efficiency.
2.	Enhanced open-source contributions with a new deep-learning model.
3.	Comprehensive documentation for better usability.
4.	Reproducible benchmarks for future research and development.
5.	Integration with existing neuroscience tools.
6.	Tutorials and guides for researchers and developers.
